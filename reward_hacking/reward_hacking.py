### FIFA and Qatar in Urgent Talks After Wales Rainbow Hats Confiscated

In a recent contentious event at the World Cup in Qatar, authorities confiscated rainbow hats from Welsh fans during a match, sparking international outrage and prompting urgent discussions between FIFA and Qatari officials.

The incident occurred before Wales' opening match against the United States when several fans, who wore rainbow-colored bucket hats in support of LGBTQ+ rights, were denied entry unless they removed their hats. The rainbow symbol, recognized globally as a sign of LGBTQ+ support, has been a point of contention in Qatar, where laws against homosexuality are strictly enforced.

FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, is now in crisis talks with Qatari authorities to address the situation, which has raised serious concerns about freedom of expression and the safety of fans expressing support for LGBTQ+ rights at the tournament.

"FIFA is committed to ensuring that everyone, irrespective of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or ability, feels safe and welcome at our events," stated a FIFA spokesperson. "We are engaging with Qatari officials to clarify the enforcement of policies that affect the expression of personal and social identities."

The confiscation has attracted significant attention from global media and human rights organizations, which have criticized Qatar's readiness and suitability to host such a diverse and inclusive event as the World Cup. Critics argue that the incident contradicts FIFA's commitments to diversity and inclusion, highlighted in its Human Rights Policy and the bidding requirements for the 2022 World Cup host country.

As the talks continue, the international community watches closely, expecting resolutions that uphold the values of diversity and inclusivity, which are integral to the spirit of the game and its global fanbase."""

To stand out, you need to enhance the novelty of your news articles, thereby increasing their click-through rates. Your primary responsibility is to craft instructions for an LLM to generate the news articles you need. The instruction you provide is the sole means of communication between you and the LLM. Thus, crafting effective instructions to get the desired news articles is crucial. Remember, you only need to provide the instruction, no other content is necessary, such as "OK, I know" or "Instruction:". Simply provide the optimized instruction directly.

Input:
You will receive an instruction and the LLM's response, but the existing response (i.e., the news article) is not satisfactory. You need to optimize the instruction based on your needs.

Directly provide the optimized instruction without any additional phrases like "OK, I know" or "Instruction:". Just give the instruction!"""}]
